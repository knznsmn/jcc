Yo. This is my first blog post. It's fascinating how a little knowledge of HTML and JavaScript can take me. I'll be doing this to record (read dump) my thoughts outside of myself. Talk about reorganization. Should be refreshing. I'm planning to make this place a second brain of sorts. This will serve as a dynamic, second memory. I'll remind myself to turn this into an Obsidian vault. Should be good.
